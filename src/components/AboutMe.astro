      Since I started my career as a developer in 2020, I have built a strong foundation in various programming languages, applying them in professional, academic, and personal projects.
      <strong>Over the past two year, I have gained valuable experience in the gaming industry</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the studios I was part of, <strong>I implemented multiplayer gameplay, back-end online services,
      and contributed to various non-programming tasks to enhance user experiences</strong>.
      These roles have deepened my proficiency and expanded my game development skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      In me, you will find a <strong>dedicated developer</strong> who is <strong>passionate about video games</strong> and <strong>proficient in C++ and Unreal Engine</strong>. 
      I am excited to contribute to the success of the projects I am a part of.
